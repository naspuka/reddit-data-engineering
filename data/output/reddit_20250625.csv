1ljq8r4,Unit tests != data quality checks. CMV.,"Unit tests <> data quality checks, for you SQL nerds :P

In post after post, I see people conflating unit/integration/e2e testing with data quality checks. I acknowledge that the concepts have some overlap,  the idea of correctness, but to me they are distinct in practice. 

Unit testing is about making sure that some dependency change or code refactor doesn’t result in bad code that gives wrong results. Integration and e2e testing are about the whole integrated pipeline performing as expected. All of those could, in theory, be written as pytest tests (maybe). It’s a “build time” construct, ie *before* your code is released. 

Data quality checks are about checking the integrity of production data as it’s already flowing, each time it flows. It’s a “runtime” construct, ie *after* your code is released. 

I’m open to changing my mind on this, but I need to  be persuaded.

1lk96qs,I performed Redshift cost reduction from 60k to 42k,"Optimization: A Deep Dive into Our $60K to $42k/Month Success
As a Redshift DBA, I successfully spearheaded a cost reduction initiative, slashing our monthly spend from a staggering $60,000 to just $42—and we're not stopping there. This significant achievement was driven by a meticulous approach to understanding and optimizing our Redshift environment.
Our key cost optimization techniques included:
 * Strategic DISTKEY and SORTKEY Refinement: We began by thoroughly analyzing all queries to intelligently redefine distribution and sort keys. This fundamental step ensures data is stored and retrieved in the most efficient manner, drastically reducing scan times and I/O.
 * Optimized Workload Management (WLM): By configuring Auto WLM with precise priority settings, we ensured critical queries received the necessary resources while preventing less urgent tasks from monopolizing the system. This balanced approach significantly improved overall cluster efficiency and reduced peak usage costs.
 * User-Centric Query Cost Analysis: We implemented a system to track the 7-day query scan cost percentage change for each user. This provided invaluable insights into individual user query patterns, allowing us to identify and address inefficient query behavior proactively.
 * Proactive Query Monitoring and Anomaly Detection: We meticulously monitored each user's query count and identified slow queries, leveraging generic hash functions for efficient tracking. This allowed us to pinpoint performance bottlenecks and optimize problematic queries before they significantly impacted costs.
 * Centralized Query Validation: To maintain optimal performance and cost efficiency, all new queries are now rigorously reviewed and validated by our DBA team before deployment. This prevents the introduction of inefficient queries that could drive up costs.
 * Regular Table Statistics Updates: We established a routine for updating statistics on all tables. Accurate statistics enable the Redshift query optimizer to generate the most efficient execution plans, leading to faster queries and lower resource consumption.
 * Consistent Table Vacuuming and Sorting: We implemented a strategy for regular VACUUM SORT operations on all tables. This reclaims space and physically reorders data according to sort keys, dramatically improving query performance and reducing scan costs.
 * Time-Series Data Optimization: For time-series data, we focused on sorting tables based on timestamps and creating dedicated time-series tables. This design pattern is highly effective for queries involving time ranges, leading to significant performance gains and cost savings.
 * Focus on Query and Scan Cost over CPU: Our philosophy shifted from merely monitoring CPU utilization to a laser focus on query and scan costs within WLM. We recognized that true optimization lies in reducing the amount of data scanned and processed, rather than just ensuring CPU availability.
 * Aborted Query and Disk I/O Analysis: We actively monitored aborted query counts and analyzed disk I/O scanning costs for each query. Identifying and resolving issues that lead to aborted queries or high I/O contributes directly to cost reduction by minimizing wasted resources.
This comprehensive approach has not only yielded substantial cost savings but has also created a more performant and manageable Redshift environment. We continue to explore new avenues for optimization, committed to maximizing efficiency and minimizing expenditure.",148,61,abhigm,2025-06-25 15:46:39,https://i.redd.it/1yumeosig39f1.jpeg,0.73,False,False,False,False

1lkfghr,I don't enjoy working with AI...do you?,"I've been a Data Engineer for 5 years, with years as an analyst prior. I chose this career path because I really like the puzzle solving element of coding, and being stinking good at data quality analysis. This is the aspect of my job that puts me into a flow state. I also have never been strong with expressing myself with words - this is something I struggle with professionally and personally. It just takes me a long time to fully articulate myself.

My company is SUPER welcoming and open of using AI. I have been willing to use AI and have been finding use cases to use AI more deeply.

I'm just feeling like even if I get really good at this, I wouldn't like it much...and not sure what this means for my employment in general.

1lk39fh,Im exhausted and questioning everything,"I moved from a startup into a corporate job ( digital banking ) a few months ago. I’m from Malaysia , for context. I’m still under probation. And honestly, I don’t know anymore if I’m underperforming, or if I’m just stuck in a dysfunctional culture that burns people out.

In my previous role, I worked as a backend engineer. I had autonomy. Things moved fast. Feedback was immediate. Now, I’m in an environment where expectations are vague, processes are messy, and communication is passive-aggressive.

One example: we have a support schedule to help vendors load data into internal systems. They can’t do it directly, so someone from our side has to run everything manually. It’s basic, repetitive work , I once suggested scripting it to make the process cleaner. That suggestion was ignored. So we keep doing it the hard way.

Recently I got pinged after working hours to join a “5-minute call to load something” , something that would run for 10 hours. There was no advance notice, just the assumption I’d be available. I was already off shift, but even then, the next day came with a passive-aggressive remark: “Didn’t expect this from you.” This wasn’t the first time either.

Then there’s the feedback I’ve been given. My boss told me twice , that I lack “initiative.” The most recent example was over documentation. I was asked to update some system design docs. I did. I even left a comment inside tagging him, asking for input , which should’ve triggered an email notification. But I didn’t follow up in Teams because I got pulled into other work. I was literally about to update him the next morning when he messaged me and immediately launched into a rant about me needing to be more proactive and take ownership. Even though the work had been done. However, sometime he would dished out praise but rarely. 

Meanwhile, I’m putting in 10–15 hour days. I’m exhausted. I forget things. I don’t have any more bandwidth. I’m not even doing meaningful engineering work , just reacting to whatever lands in my inbox or chat window. No ownership, no growth. Just people assuming I’ll pick up anything and everything.

This is starting to affect my personal life. I carry the resentment home. I’m always tired. I’m checked out even when I’m not working. I literally can’t take a shit without being pulled into a meeting.

So now I’m asking: is this a sign I’m not fit for this kind of culture? Am I truly missing something basic? Or is this what happens when you take someone from a fast, transparent, builder-type environment and drop them into a place where nobody wants to own problems , they just want someone to quietly clean up the mess?

If you’ve been through this, I’d appreciate perspective.",20,4,neosisrube,2025-06-25 11:34:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1lk39fh/im_exhausted_and_questioning_everything/,0.92,False,False,False,False

1lk5efs,Dear data engineer ( asking help for a junior ),"Dear friends, I recently finished my evening course for Data Analytics while doing 40 hour work week as a front end dev.

I was very unhappy as a webdev since the work pressure was really high and I couldn’t keep with while trying to develop my skills.

I deeply enjoyed my data analytics course ( Learned Powerbi, SSMS already knew some SQL, general DWH / ETL )

This month ( start of june ) I started as a BI specialist, ( fancy word for Data engineer ). It has significantly less powerbi than I expected and is actually 80% modelling / DWH work.

There isn’t any direct Data employee, they have a consultant that visits once every 2 weeks and I can contact him online. When he’s teaching me he’s very helpful and I learn a lot. But like any consultant he’s incredibly bizzy as per usual.

There is so much I still need to learn and realize. I am 22, and super willing to learn more in my free time, luckily my work environment isn’t soulcrushing but I want to make something of the opportunity. So far my work has provided me with udemy and I’m also going to get DataCamp. Still I was wondering if any of you guys had advice for me to improve myself and become a worthy Data engineer / data guy.

Since right now it almost feels like starting as junior dev again that doesn’t know crap. But I’m motivated to work to get past that point. I just get the feeling it might not come from just doing my best at my workplace, just like when I was working as a webdev. I don’t want to fall behind my age <=> expected skill level

1lkalnw,Request for Architecture Review – Talend ESB High-Volume XML Processing,"
Hello,

In my current role, I’ve taken over a data exchange system handling approximately 50,000 transactions per day. I’m seeking your input or suggestions for a modernized architecture using the following technologies:
	•	Talend ESB
	•	ActiveMQ
	•	PostgreSQL

Current Architecture:

1.	Input
The system exposes 10 REST/SOAP APIs to receive data structured around a core XML (id, field1, field2, xml, etc.). Each API performs two actions:
	•	Inserts the data into the PostgreSQL database
	•	Sends the id to an ActiveMQ queue for downstream processing

2.	Transformation
A job retrieves the XML and transforms it into a generic XML format using XSLT.

3.	Target Eligibility
The system evaluates the eligibility of the data for 30 possible target applications by calling 30 separate APIs (Talend ESB API). Each API:
	•	Analyzes the generic XML and returns a boolean (true/false)
	•	If eligible, publishes the id to the corresponding ActiveMQ queue
	•	The responses are aggregated into a JSON object:

{
  ""target1"": true,
  ...
  ""target30"": false
}

This JSON is then stored in the database.

4.	Distribution
One job per target reads its corresponding ActiveMQ queue and routes the data to the target system via the appropriate protocol (database, email, etc.)

Main Issue:
This architecture struggles under high load due to the volume of API calls (30 per transaction).

I would appreciate your feedback or suggestions for improving and modernizing this pipeline.",2,3,Plane_Expression2000,2025-06-25 16:39:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1lkalnw/request_for_architecture_review_talend_esb/,0.76,False,False,False,False
1lka20n,Data Engineering for Gen AI?,"I'm not talking about Gen AI doing data engineering work... specifically what does data engineering look like for supporting Gen AI services/products?

Below are a few thoughts from what i've seen in the market and my own building; but I would love to hear what others are seeing!

1. A key differentiator for quality LLM output is providing it great context, thus the role of information organization, data mining, and information retrieval is becoming more important. With that said, I don't see traditional data modeling fully fitting this paradigm given that the relationship are much more flexible with LLMs. Something I'm thinking about is what are identifiers around ""text themes"" an modeling around that (I could 100% be over complicating this though).

2. I think security and governance controls are going to become more important in data engineering. Before LLMs, it was pretty hard to expose sensitive data without gross negligence. Today with consumer focused AI, people are sending PII to these AI tools that are then sending it to their external APIs (especially among non-technical users). I think people will come to their senses soon, but the barriers of protection via processes and training have been eroded substantially with the easy adoption of AI.

3. Data integrations with third parties is going to become trivial. For example, say you don't have budget for Fivetran and have to build your own connection from Salesforce to your data warehouse. The process of going through API docs, building a pipeline, parsing nested JSON, dealing with edge cases, etc takes a long time. I see a move towards offloading this work to AI ""agents"" (loaded term now I know), but essentially I'm seeing traction with MCP server. So data eng work is less around building data models for other humans, but instead for external AI agents to work with.

Is this matching what you are seeing?

So my question is which will be the most beneficial. Or do I just have to wait for an opportunity. Any tips are appreciated. ",0,4,hijkblck93,2025-06-25 04:34:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1ljwjaw/curious_about_next_steps_as_a_mid_career_de_cert/,0.5,False,False,False,False
1ljwhsq,Data Engineer Looking to Upskill in GenAI — Anyone Tried Summit Mittal’s Course?,"**Hi everyone,**

As we all know, GenAI is rapidly transforming the tech landscape, and I’m planning to upskill myself in this domain.

I have around 4 years of experience in data engineering, and after some research, the **Summit Mittal GenAI Master Program** caught my attention. It seems to be one of the most structured courses available, but it comes with a hefty price tag of ₹50,000.

Before I commit, I’d love to hear from those who’ve actually taken this course:

* Did it truly help you land better career opportunities?
* Does it offer real-world, industry-relevant projects and skills?
* Was it worth the investment?

Also, if you’ve come across **any other high-value or affordable courses (or even YouTube resources)** that helped you upskill in GenAI effectively, please do share your recommendations.

Your feedback would mean a lot—thanks in advance!",0,9,Physical_Shelter_285,2025-06-25 04:32:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1ljwhsq/data_engineer_looking_to_upskill_in_genai_anyone/,0.5,False,False,False,False

1lk9ilw,Production data pipelines 3-5× faster using Claude + Keboola’s built-in AI agent interface,"[An example of Claude fixing a job error.](https://i.redd.it/fgdaw8ptp19f1.gif)

*We recently launched full AI assistant integration inside our data platform (Keboola), powered by the* [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://help.keboola.com/ai/mcp-server/). It’s now live and already helping teams move 3-5x faster from spec to working pipeline.  
  
Here’s how it works

**1. Prompt**

 I ask Claude something like:

>1. Pull contacts from my Salesforce CRM.  
2. Pull my billing data from Stripe.  
3. Join the contacts and billing and calculate LTV.  
4. Upload the data to BigQuery.  
5. Create a flow based on these points and schedule it to run weekly on Monday at 7:00am my time.

**2. Build**  
The AI agent connects to our Keboola project (via OAuth) using the Keboola MCP server, and:  
– creates input tables  
– writes working SQL transformations  
– sets up individual components to extract data from or write into, which can be then connected into  fully orchestrated flows.  
– auto-documents the steps

**3. Run + Self-Heal**  
The agent launches the job and monitors its status.  
If the job fails, it doesn’t wait for you to ask - it automatically analyzes logs, identifies the issue, and proposes a fix.  
If everything runs smoothly, it keeps going or checks in for the next action.  
  
**What about control & security?**  
Keboola stays in the background. The assistant connects via scoped OAuth or access tokens, with no data copied or stored.  
You stay fully in charge:  
– Secure by design  
– Full observability  
– Governance and lineage intact  
So yes - you can vibe-code your pipelines in natural language… but this time with trust.  
  
**The impact?**  
*In real projects, we’re seeing a 3-5x acceleration in pipeline delivery — and fewer handoffs between analysts, engineers, and ops.*  
  
**Curious** if others are giving LLMs access to production tooling.  
**What workflows have worked (or backfired) for you?**

1lk35s6,Why You Need a Data Lakehoue?,"# Background to the introduction of Paimon and the main issues addressed

**1. Offline Timeliness Bottlenecks**

From the internal applications shared by various companies, most of the scenarios are Lambda architecture at the same time. The biggest problem of offline batch processing architecture is storage and timeliness. Hive itself has limited capability on storage, most of the scenarios are **INSERT OVERWRITE**, and basically do not care about the file organization form.

Paimon on behalf of the lake framework can be fine management of each file, in addition to simple **INSERT OVERWRITE**, with a more powerful ACID capabilities, can stream write to achieve minute-level updates.

**2. Real-Time Pipeline Headaches**

**Flink + MQ-based real-time pipeline, the main problems include:**

1. Higher cost, numerous technology stacks around Flink, high management and operation and maintenance costs; and because the intermediate results do not land, a large number of dump tasks are needed to assist in problem localization and data repair;
2. task stability, stateful computation leads to delays and other problems;
3. intermediate results do not land, a large number of auxiliary tasks are needed to assist in troubleshooting problems.

So we can qualitatively give Paimon to solve the problem of a conclusion: unify the flow batch link, improve the time and reduce costs at the same time.

# Core scenarios and solutions

**1. Unified Data Ingestion (Upgrading ODS Layers)**

In the sharing of major companies, it is mentioned about using Paimon instead of the traditional Hive ODS layer, and Paimon is used as the unified mirror table of the whole business database to improve the timeliness of the data link and optimize the storage space.

The actual production link brings the following benefits:

1. In the traditional offline and real-time links, ODS is carried by Hive table and MQ (usually Kafka) respectively, in the new link Paimon table is used as a unified storage for ODS, which can satisfy both streaming and batch reads;
2. After adopting Paimon, since the whole link is quasi-real-time, the processing time can be shortened from hourly to minute level, usually controlled within ten minutes;
3. Paimon has good support for concurrent write operations, and Paimon supports both primary and non-primary key tables;

It is worth mentioning here that Shopee has developed a Paimon Branch-based “day-cut function”. Simply put, the data is sliced according to the day, avoiding the problem of redundant storage of data in the full-volume partition.

In addition, the Paimon community also provides a set of tools that can help you carry out schema evolution, synchronize MySQL or even Kafka data to Paimon, and add columns upstream, the Paimon table will also follow the increase in columns.

**2. Dimension Tables for Lookup Joins**

Paimon primary key table as a dimension table scenario, there are mature applications in major companies, the actual production environment has been tested many times.

Paimon as a dimension table scenarios are divided into two categories, one is the real-time dimension table: through the Flink task to pick up the business database real-time updates; the other is the offline dimension table, that is, through the Spark offline task T +1 update, is also the vast majority of data scenarios of the dimension table.

Paimon dimension table can also support Flink Streamin SQL tasks and Flink Batch tasks.

**3. Paimon Building Wide Tables**

Paimon and many other frameworks, support Partial Update, LSM Tree architecture makes Paimon has a very high point checking and merging performance, but here to pay special attention to a few points:

Performance bottlenecks, in the ultra-large-scale data update or ultra-multi-column update scenarios, the background merger performance will have a significant decline, need to be careful to test the use of;

Sequence Group sorting, when the business has more than one stream for the splicing, will be given to each stream definition of a separate Sequence Group, the Sequence Group sorting fields need to be reasonably selectable, and even have more than one field sorting, the Sequence Group will have to be used in the same way as the other frameworks. There will even be multiple field sorting;

**4. PV/UV Tracking**

In the example of PayPal calculating PV/UV metrics, it was previously implemented using Flink's full stateful links, but then it was found difficult to migrate a large number of operations to this model, so it was replaced with Paimon.

Paimon's upsert (update or insert) update mechanism is utilized for de-duplication, and Paimon's lightweight logging, changlog, is used to consume the data and provide real-time PV (Page View) and UV calculations downstream.

In terms of overall resource consumption, the Paimon solution resulted in a 60% reduction in overall CPU utilization, while checkpoint stability was significantly improved. Additionally, because Paimon supports point-to-point writes, task rollback and reset times are dramatically reduced. The overall architecture has become simpler, and therefore a reduction in business development costs has been realized.

**5. Lakehouse OLAP Pipelines**

Because of the high degree of integration between Spark and Paimon, some ETL operations are performed through Spark or Flink, data is written to Paimon, z-order sorting, clustering, and even building file-level indexes based on Paimon, and then OLAP queries are performed through Doris or StarRocks, so that the full link can be achieved! OLAP effect.
